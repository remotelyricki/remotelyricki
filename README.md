# Remotely Ricki

Hello World! My name is Ricki and I would like to welcome you to my portfolio. I will be documenting my journey into the world of code and the knowledge I picked up on the way. Enjoy the ride!

## Languages

- **HTML**
  - I currently have some experience with HTML, but I will be starting with the basics in order to master the basics before I move on. I will be showcasing some very basic HTML projects to show my understanding of the topic.
- **CSS**
  - I also have a good understanding of CSS, but again will be starting with the basics. I need to especially focus on how to make a website mobile responsive as well as have a better undertanding on how exactly certain properties work.
- **JavaScript**
  - I have the least amount of knowledge in JavaScript. This is where I will probably do the most work to fully grasp each concept.
- **More**
  - I will be adding to this list as I go to showcase what I have learned as I go.

## Built With
This will be updated as I work on the portfolio more.
